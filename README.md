# Mobility Data Specification on Govs

## Quickstart

Mobility Data Specification is a data standard that can be integrated as a policy with Govs via API and Mobile App for teams 
working on public or private projects requiring a fast, secure, and scalable monitoring of mobility data.

This Data Standard was created by Open Mobility Foundation and this is a quickstart for Developer & Operators to deploy it using DataGovs App.

## Use Cases

- Deploy Mobility Data Specification using Govs as API Management and Version Control
- Securely connect assets to comply with the Mobility Data Compliance 
- Publish in public or private - status, availability, and regulations
